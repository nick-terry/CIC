# CIC (Cross-Entropy Information Criterion)

The CIC is a statistic which can be used to design algorithms for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution" Boltzmann approximation problem /a>. It is theoretically developed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04315" this paper /a> by Choe et al. 

This repository contains:
1. An implementation for an algorithm described in the paper which solves the Boltzmann approximation problem using the CIC.
2. Code for reproducing all experiments described in the paper.
